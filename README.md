# pygitgrab 

grab only certain information from remote git repo and store them local

# general information

`pygitgrab` is not intended to be a replacement for git and it's capabilities.
`pygitgrab` will not do housekeeping, meaning maintaing the local directory content like syncing or such a like.
in case remote files or folders are dropped it is required to clean local folders manually.

# installation

the module is on [pypi](https://pypi.org/kr-g/pygitgrab) and can be installed with pip

# run from cmd line

    python3 -m pygitgrab -h
    
    python3 -m pygitgrab -u user_name # user_name is optional, will prompt for password
    
github offers downloading for unauthenticed users only within certain rate limits [https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/).
in case downloading a bunch of serveral project files it is required to authenticate.


# pygg.cfg structure

`pygitgrab` loads a `pygg.cfg` config file from the current directory to perform the required steps.
the structure is as following:

    [repo_alias]
    # url to repo
    url=https://github.com/_owner_name_/_repo_name_
    # optional version to check out, defaults to 'master'
    tag=master
    # optional destination folder given, defaults to 'repo_alias' (name of this section in the config file)
    # pull_alias is just a name for the pull task
    pull_alias="*.py", "new_folder"
    # sample for pulling a license and store them at a different place
    license="LICENSE.md", "license/a_license.MD"
    

`pygitgrab` will create the directory structure as found in the remote git repo when pattern matching is used.

`pygitgrab` uses python [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html).
general information regarding the syntax can be found there.

# 3rd party licenses

when you move 3rd party license information into the special folder 'LICENSE' the cmd `python3 -m pygitgrab -L` will produce a summary of all found licences together with a 'LICENSE' file found in the current directory. use as `python3 -m pygitgrab -L > LICENSES` to produce a summary plain text file.


# limitations

works only with github as backend.
